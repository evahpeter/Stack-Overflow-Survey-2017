# Project1

This project is titled 'A Data Science Blog Post'.

The [Stack Overflow 2017 survey] https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 data was used here in order to glean some insight into professional developers; who they are and what they use.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook running Python 3 with the libraries numpy, pandas, seaborn, chart_studio and matplotlib. These can be installed using pip but should be included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project was written as part of the Udacity Data Scientist course. I used the Stack Overflow survey data due to my interest in professional software developers.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
StackOverflow.ipynb contains the Python code for this project.
It assumes that the survey data is in the same directory.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
In this notebook, I posed a series of questions related to the gathered data:
1. Countries with the most active developers using StackOverflow
2. Job and career satisfaction for most developers on StackOverflow
3. The most frequent languages, technologies and technologies used by professionals

I found out the following:
* The most active stackOverflow users are professional developers based in the United States. India comes in at a distant second closely followed by the UK, Germany, Canada nad France in that order. The data shows the developers are mostly based in first-world/western countries.
* In terms of the job satisfaction among professional developers, one can readily see that the majority of developers are Moderately satisfied with their job and career (42% Job Satisfaction and 47.8% Career Satisfaction). The good news from the data is a sizeable number of the developers Extremely Satisfied with their job and career (24.1% Job Satisfaction and 25.7% Career satisfaction). Overall, the data tells us that a job/career in software development has a tendency to bring more satisfaction career-wise and job-wise to the developer.
* JavaScript, C#, Java and SQL and Python are the most 5 used languages by professional developers. From the most used frameworks you can see that most of them is JavaScript based; as AngularJS, Node.js and React. MySQL and SQL server are the most commonly used databases.
